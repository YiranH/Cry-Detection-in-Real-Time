# Cry Detection
A course project for CSCE 636, Neural Networks

For every part , I will create a new branch named part$i. Please switch to the corresponding branch to see new codes, data, and results. All instructions will be put in the README file in the master branch. Please follow the instructions in the corresponding part.

PART4

1. My codes on Github: https://github.com/YiranH/Cry-Detection-in-Real-Time.git

2. My codes and data on Google Colab: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17LOBLJLDFgHtDvpQV39D5OBpooPrtlvv?usp=sharing

   Demo code on Google Colab (Used in tutorial video): https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zkCj8RuzFhZBRaLI-pJrp7SIJ4Tkd7eu

   In Part 4, the demo code starts from your video.
